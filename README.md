# Project 081

Running Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger on Early 2008 [Penryn] Macs

Project 081 is a simple to use unofficial Mac OS X modification which can install Tiger on some specific models. (see support below)

It is a continuation of the older and flawed The81Project which too allowed you to install Tiger on 2008 Macs.
It currently offers

- Close to vanilla experience without days of tinkering
- Many different patched drivers to get more things functional
- Next to perfect compatibility
- No bootloader needed before and after installation
- One disk image, works on both supported and unsupported Macs (doesn't install unnecessary patches)
- Package included which automatically installs necessary patches.

## Compatibility

On any version of Mac OS X, installed or recovery, open the terminal and run sysctl hw.model

It should report back one of the following:

### Desktop
##### iMac8,1
##### MacPro3,1
##### XServe2,1

### Laptop
##### MacBook3,1
##### MacBook4,1
##### MacBookPro4,1
##### MacBookAir1,1

If it's not one of these, it's either too new or natively supported.

## Issues

For MacBookAir1,1, MacBook3,1, MacBook4,1, XServe2,1 users:
No GPU Acceleration which may cause slowdown.

For iMac8,1 users
Everything works, but DO NOT install the AirPort 2010 update
It may brick your wireless forcing you to reinstall.
